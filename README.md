Hi everyone,
Iam Ramin and This is My first Attemp on Publishing a Full Scale app based on React Native,
This project is at its early stages but daily updates are on the way.
Although this is the first attempt but I am using the industry norms here.
the Technologies that are present in this project and you can use them freely are :
1. Hooks (useEffects, useContext, useState)
2. avoidance of props drilling with several solutions
3. Navigations
4. Reducer
5. Redux
6. API implementation
7. Restful API
8. axios
9. axios looping
10. CRUD with Hooks
11. form design with Hooks, React native and React native paper
12. industry standard authentication solution
13. Token available in the whole program with the help of useContext
14. functional sign in/ sign up/ forgot password pages
15. several Card designs based on the sitution
16. theme concept usage
17. styled functioning throughout the code
18. google free font implementation
****************************************************************************************
Main updates in the following months include:
1. improving UI design
2. cleaning up the code
3. using home-made APIs
